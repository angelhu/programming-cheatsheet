        <h2>Line-height</h2>
        <p>The amount of spaces above and below an element, CANNOT be negative.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p class="small">Here is an example of a paragraph with multiple lines to show how a smaller line-height looks like. The lines should be pushed closer together, aka a very small space above and below each line.</p>

        <p class="big">Here is an example of a paragraph with multiple lines to show how a bigger line-height looks like. The lines should be more spread out, aka a bigger space above and below each line.</p>

        <p>This is the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_line-height.asp">website</a> I read about it.</p>
